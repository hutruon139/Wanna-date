# Project Title: Wanna Date? (React)
This project is a playful and interactive web application built with React and Vite. The main feature is a digital card that flips open to reveal a message asking the viewer, "Wanna Date?" when hovered over. The Yes/No interactions are rendered as React routes so you can keep practicing with components and navigation.
